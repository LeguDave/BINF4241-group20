Group 20

If you want to decide, what size the gameboard should
have, you can change the number X in the first line
in the main class. The number X must be at least 2.
The default number for X is 15:

         game testgame = new game(X);

You can add players by adding the following line
into the main class where it is marked:

         testgame.add_player("Player Name");

Then you can run the main class and start the game.
A player has to press the enter button to take his turn.
Good luck and have fun :D
